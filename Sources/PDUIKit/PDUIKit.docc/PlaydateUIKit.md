# ``PDUIKit``

Build beautiful user interfaces for apps and games on Playdate with
PlaydateKit.

## Overview

**PDUIKit** is a complementary package that provides developers the
tools needed to built consistent user interfaces for apps and games on the
[Playdate](https://play.date) game console. It leverages the `PlaydateKit`
library and is designed to have a similar feel to Apple's UIKit library
for iOS, iPadOS, and tvOS.

> Important: PlaydateUIKit is still a work in progress and is considered
> pre-release software. APIs may change over time and are not
> representative of the final shipping build. Use at your own risk!
